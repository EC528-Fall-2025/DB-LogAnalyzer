 "examples": [
   "commit_unknown_result",
   "Master recovery from pre-existing database",
   "Coordinated conflict — restarting recovery"
 ],
 "recovery_phase": "During Recovery",
 "meaning": "A recovery already in progress restarts due to conflicting coordinator state or commit ambiguity. Often triggered when multiple coordinators or masters compete during ongoing recovery, causing a cascade of restarts."

 "representative_comment": "Tag throttling / GRV stall",
 "examples": [
   "GRV proxy returning tag throttle",
   "Throttle before GRV request"
 ],
 "recovery_phase": "During Recovery",
 "meaning": "Indicates throttling or rate-limiting in the GRV (GetReadVersion) phase. Flow control is applied when proxies or tags are congested; can cause temporary stalls but does not necessarily restart recovery."

 "examples": [
   "TLog degraded",
   "Partial commit fixes",
   "Exclude failed TLog",
   "Stopped by CC recovery"
 ],
 "recovery_phase": "Forced Recovery",
 "meaning": "Signals that a Transaction Log (TLog) has failed or produced inconsistent data (e.g., partial commits, torn writes). The cluster controller forces a new recovery cycle to exclude or replace the failed TLog."

 "examples": [
   "KeyValueStoreMemory switching to large txn",
   "DiskQueue popped not durable"
 ],
 "recovery_phase": "Post Recovery",
 "meaning": "Reflects I/O pressure or durability throttling after recovery completes. Usually not a failure — indicates that disk or buffer backpressure is limiting throughput once the cluster has resumed normal operation."

 ],
 "recovery_phase": "Forced Recovery",
 "meaning": "A fatal crash in the commit or resolver pipeline triggers a cluster-wide recovery. Often results from proxy unresponsiveness or version-vector inconsistency cascading to the master process."
